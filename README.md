# Project: Majma' (مَجمَع)

This project is a "link-in-bio" tool, designed to be a single, customizable landing page that hosts all of a user's important links.

## MVP Plan

1.  **User-Facing Page**: A static HTML/CSS page for a single user.
2.  **Link Management**: Links will be hardcoded in the HTML for the initial prototype.
3.  **Future goals**: User registration, dynamic link management, and analytics.
